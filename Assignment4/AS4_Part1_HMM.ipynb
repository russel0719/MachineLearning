The EM algorithm has some nice properties: it is guaranteed at each step to decrease the loss function, and the E-step and M-step may have an exact closed form solution, in which case no pesky learning rates are required.\n","\n","But because the HMM forward algorithm is differentiable with respect to all the model parameters, we can also just take advantage of automatic differentiation methods in libraries like PyTorch and try to minimize $-\\text{log }p_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})$ directly, by backpropagating through the forward algorithm and running stochastic gradient descent. That means we don't need to write any additional HMM code to implement training: `loss.backward()` is all you need."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"aVh0-369qZDC"},"source":["Here we will implement SGD training for an HMM in PyTorch.
